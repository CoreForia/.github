# 👋 Welcome to CoreForia

**CoreForia** is a **founder-led development studio** focused on building  
**gaming-driven software, tools, and scalable digital systems**.

We design and engineer projects where **code, infrastructure, UX, and community mechanics** work together — with a strong focus on **gaming, modding, and platform development**.

---

## 🏗️ Studio & Founder Vision

CoreForia operates as an **independent studio**, not a collection of one-off projects.

The studio focuses on:
- long-term maintainable systems  
- clean technical foundations  
- modular and reusable architectures  
- products that scale with communities  

Many projects originate from real needs inside gaming ecosystems and evolve into frameworks, tools, or platforms.

> We don’t just ship features — we build foundations.

## 🎮 Gaming-first, but not gaming-only

Gaming is the core driver behind most projects, especially in areas like:

- 🎮 Game mods & add-ons  
- 🧩 Frameworks for servers and communities  
- ⚙️ Developer tooling for live environments  
- 🖥️ UI, HUD, and in-game UX systems  
- 🌐 Supporting web platforms and services  

The same standards apply everywhere:  
**clean code, clear structure, future-proof decisions**.

## 🧠 Technical Philosophy

All CoreForia projects follow a shared technical mindset:

- 🔧 Systems over scripts  
- 🧩 Modularity and reusability first  
- 🧪 Prototyping with intent  
- 📦 Clear separation of logic, UI, and data  
- 📐 Consistency across repositories  

Tech stacks vary per project but commonly include:
- modern JavaScript and TypeScript  
- game-specific scripting environments  
- backend and infrastructure tooling  
- shared internal libraries

## 🧩 What lives in this organization

This GitHub organization hosts:

- 🛠️ Core libraries and internal frameworks  
- 🎮 Game-related tools, mods, and extensions  
- 🧱 Foundational systems for larger platforms  
- 🧪 Experimental repositories and prototypes  

Some repositories are public, others are work-in-progress or internal.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Contributions

CoreForia is founder-driven but collaboration-friendly.

Where repositories are open:
- issues and pull requests are welcome  
- technical discussions are encouraged  
- constructive feedback is appreciated  

Contribution rules are defined per project.

---

## 🧭 Studio Mindset

CoreForia exists between:
- an indie development studio  
- a technical playground  
- and a long-term ecosystem builder  

Not everything here is meant to be fast.  
Most things here are meant to last.

## ✨ Philosophy

> Build like it will still matter in two years.  
> Design like someone else will maintain it.  
> Ship when it’s ready — not when it’s loud.
